# match3

Im currently a computing engineering student at Pontificia Universidad Catolica Argentina, learning videogame development following Harvards CS50's Introduction to Game Development lectures. Link to the lectures on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T383Vx9-4vJYFsJbvZ_D17Qzh
Disclaimer, my code is clearly influenced by CS50's professor Colton Ogden, I will try to properly credit his work through this project.

Developed to run on Love2d (an open cross-platform engine for developing 2d videogames). More info at: https://love2d.org/
